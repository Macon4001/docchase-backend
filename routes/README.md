# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

These JavaScript route files are **no longer used** and kept for reference only.

The active codebase is in `src/routes/` (TypeScript).

## Migration Status

All routes have been migrated to TypeScript in `src/routes/`:
- `routes/auth.js` → `src/routes/auth.ts`
- `routes/dashboard.js` → `src/routes/dashboard.ts`
- `routes/clients.js` → `src/routes/clients.ts`
- `routes/campaigns.js` → `src/routes/campaigns.ts`
- `routes/webhooks/twilio.js` → `src/routes/webhooks.ts`

**Do not edit these files.** Edit the TypeScript versions in `src/routes/` instead.

These files can be safely deleted once confirmed no external scripts reference them.
